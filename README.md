# 👥 Employee Turnover Prediction  
### Machine Learning Feature Importance & Classification Project

This project applies multiple supervised machine learning algorithms to **analyze and predict employee turnover** based on HR-related data. The primary objective is to identify the **most significant features** that influence whether an employee stays or leaves.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- Binary classification task: **Left (1)** vs. **Stayed (0)**
- Goal: Understand key drivers of employee attrition and predict turnover
- Uses cross-validation to ensure model robustness
- Comparative analysis across multiple classifiers
- Evaluation of model performance and feature importance

---

## 🧪 Models Applied

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- AdaBoost
- Naive Bayes
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## 🧩 Key Steps

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling and transformation
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- K-Fold cross-validation (10-fold)
- Evaluation using classification metrics

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Classification Report (Precision, Recall)
- Feature Importance (especially from tree-based models)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
